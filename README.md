The Clean Up Config tool, is a tool used by Fortinet TAC engineers to clean up some of the customer settings that are not important and/or cause issues when a firewall configuration is imported into Fortinet LAB.
For example, if customer does not have the default admin account the script will make sure the admin account is added without a password. Another example would be if customer is using trusthost in all admin account, after importing the configuration from customer you will lose access to the LAB. So the script will make sure that all 'set trusthost' entries in all admin accounts are removed allowing access to the FGT login page from anywhere.
